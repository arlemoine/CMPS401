# Git Setup in VM

1. Navigate to the repository page in your web browser. Copy the URL.

2. Log into VM and navigate to the directory where you wish for the GitHub repository to reside. This will look something like this:

```bash
# Make a Projects folder at your root directory
mkdir Projects
# Navigate to the new directory ("change directory")
cd Projects/
```

3. Clone the GitHub repository to your VM. This may require authentication to GitHub services.

```bash
# Clone the repository to your VM
git clone <URL>
```

4. Refer to guide for [basic Linux commands](basic_linux_commands.md) as needed.
